<h3 id="i_1">1. The Index.</h3>

<p>In 1901, a reviewer of the Roman Index
of Forbidden Books opened his criticism by
congratulating himself upon having before
him a genuine copy of that book, of which,
he says, only a very limited number were
printed for the exclusive use of “the leaders
of the Church.” Owing to its scarcity,
he thinks, the owner of the volume, which
he had borrowed, must have paid at least
two hundred dollars for it. He could have
bought a brand new copy for $2.25. The
Index of which he speaks, issued by order
of Leo XIII, in 1900, is for sale in this
country by B. Herder, St. Louis, Mo. So
<a name="png.p02" id="png.p02" href="#png.p02"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>2<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>are the three later editions (1901, 1904,
1907), the last two issued under, and by
order of, our gloriously reigning Pontiff,
Pius<!-- TN: original reads "Pious" --> X. When the critic felt his heart
beat with joy upon being allowed to view
with his own blessed eyes a book so rare,
so expensive, and so jealously guarded by
“the leaders of the Church,” a whole edition
of that same book had already been
sold, and a second was about to be put on
the market. Its title is now:</p>

<p><cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Index librorum prohibitorum, Leonis XIII Sum. Pont. auctoritate recognitus
SS. D. N. Pii P. X iussu editus. Præmittuntur
Constitutiones Apostolicæ de examine
et prohibitione librorum.</cite> (Index of
forbidden books, revised by the authority
of Pope Leo XIII, and issued by order of
His Holiness Pope Pius X. Preceded by
the Apostolic Constitutions on the examination
and prohibition of books.)</p>

<p>A glance at the neatly printed volume
will disclose the reason why it is called
“Index”;—almost nine-tenths of it consists
of a catalogue of books condemned
by the Roman authorities. Of still greater
<a name="png.p03" id="png.p03" href="#png.p03"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>3<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>importance than this catalogue are the first
thirty-four pages, which give, in the
“Apostolic Constitutions,” the general laws
of the Church regarding books.</p>

<p>There are only two “Constitutions.”
But the whole work is introduced by a
brief of Leo XIII, in which the Pontiff declares
that this edition is to be the authentic
one for the whole Church. <em>It is to be
binding on all the faithful of the universe,
regardless of race or language, nationality
or country, education, learning or station
in life.</em> In a preface headed “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lectori S.</span>,”
the Secretary of the Roman “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Congregatio
Indicis</span>” compares this edition of the “Index”
with the former ones, points out the
changes that were made, and explains the
technical arrangement of the book.</p>

<p>After these preliminaries follow the
“Constitutions.” The first is the “Officiorum
ac munerum” of Leo XIII, dated
Jan. 25, 1896. This document recasts the
whole legislation of the Church regarding
the production, dissemination, reprinting
and prohibition of such books as the Church
may and must concern herself with. It
<a name="png.p04" id="png.p04" href="#png.p04"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>4<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>abrogates all former laws and regulations of
General Councils as well as of Sovereign
Pontiffs, with one exception: the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Constitution
Sollicita ac provida</span> of Benedict XIV,
also reprinted here, by which this great
pope established or rather sanctioned a
method—the one still in use—of examining
and passing sentence on the books
submitted to the Roman authorities.</p>

<p>These two Constitutions contain the entire
general legislation of the Church on
the head of books.</p>

<p>There is no “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Index expurgatorius</span>.” If
there were, it would consist of books condemned
conditionally, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donec corrigatur<!-- TN: original reads "corrigantur" --></i>,
“until amended.” But such books are all
entered in the ordinary Index, with those
two Latin words added. In Pope Leo’s
edition they are, besides, marked with an
asterisk.</p>


<h3 id="i_2">2. The Power of the Church.</h3>

<p>That the Church has the right to legislate
on the publication and use of all books
that touch on questions of faith and morals,
must be evident to every Catholic. It is
<a name="png.p05" id="png.p05" href="#png.p05"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>5<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>a truth clearly contained in the words of
Christ to St. Peter: “Feed my lambs,
feed my sheep,” and in the duty imposed
on the Apostles of “teaching the faithful
to observe all, whatsoever I have commanded
you.”</p>

<p>The fact that general councils as well
as many popes have issued laws and decrees
regarding books, is sufficient evidence
of their power and of their commission to
do this. This very fact must also convince
us that the observation of these laws must
be salutary and conducive to the welfare of
the Church at large and of the individual
Christian.</p>

<p>The inventions, discoveries and progress
of our times can introduce no change in
this respect. The human mind is still as
prone to err and as much subject to the
persuasive influence of books as it ever
was. Good books are as useful to-day as
they were in olden times, and objectionable
writings have the same deplorable effects
they had a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Nor can the Church, possessing the
power to watch over our reading, neglect
<a name="png.p06" id="png.p06" href="#png.p06"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to make use of this power when the salvation
of souls calls for its exercise. Bad
literature is one of the worst enemies of
mankind. The Church can never allow it
to corrupt the hearts of her children or to
undermine the foundation of their faith,
without at least raising a warning voice.</p>

<p>How great are the precautions the civil
authorities take in case of an epidemic; yet,
no matter how seriously the precautions
hamper traffic and trade, we find them reasonable.
We should even censure our executive
and legislative officers if they omitted
to take proper precautions. But, says
Pope Leo, in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Constitution Officiorum ac
munerum</span>, nothing can be conceived more
pernicious, more apt to defile souls than
uncurbed license in the writing and disseminating
of bad books. “Therefore,” he
continues, “the Church, whose office it is
to watch over the integrity of faith and
morals, has ever striven, as far as in her
power lay, to restrain the faithful from the
reading of bad books as from a deadly
poison.”</p>

Roman Index.</h3>

<p>“The early days of the Church witnessed
the earnest zeal of St. Paul,” when the
Christians at Ephesus brought together all
the superstitious books they had in their
possession and burned them publicly. This
example of loyalty to the Church cost
them, as Holy Scripture says, between
eight and nine thousand dollars. Such was
the policy in regard to bad books at Ephesus
at a time when the Apostle whom
many love to call the most liberal and
broadminded, ruled that part of the Church.</p>

<p>Every subsequent age records similar
measures of vigilance. The first General
Council of Nicæa, in 325, besides proscribing
the heresy of Arius, also issued a decree
prohibiting the use of Arius’ book
<cite>Thalia</cite>, which contained his heresy; indeed,
at all times the condemnation of a heresy
by the Church entailed the prohibition of
the works propagating it. Pope St. Leo
the Great, 440–461, does not hesitate to
declare that one who reads forbidden
<a name="png.p08" id="png.p08" href="#png.p08"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>books cannot be considered a Catholic.</p>

<p>In the early days the Church had to
direct her attention largely to the many
so-called apocryphal books, falsely claimed
to have been inspired by God and to form
part of Holy Scripture. In 496, Pope
Gelasius issued his famous decree, in which
he enumerates the true books of the Bible,
a number of the writings of the Fathers,
(which he recommends,) together with a
short list of apocryphal and heretical books,
the reading of which he forbids.</p>

<p>In 745, by order of the Pope, a Roman
synod examined and forbade a number of
superstitious books sent by St. Boniface,
who had found them among the Germans.</p>

<p>In fact, already in those days the entire
present-day book legislation of the Church
existed in all its essential features, though
there were few written decrees. It seems
the loyal Christian’s duty of avoiding bad
books, and the power of the Church to prohibit
them, were held to be so self-evident
that the need of written laws was not felt.</p>

<p>The necessity of watching over the mental
food of the faithful became more urgent
<a name="png.p09" id="png.p09" href="#png.p09"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>when, in the fifteenth century, was invented
<em>printing</em>, which popes and bishops hailed
as a “divine art” and eulogised as the
greatest blessing of God’s providence in the
natural order. It spread rapidly. Before
the year 1500, the city of Rome alone had
one hundred and ninety printing establishments.
The oldest of them, in the first
seven years of its existence, produced not
less than twenty-eight works in forty-seven
editions, the total number of pages being
one hundred and twenty-four millions.</p>

<p>As to the moral quality of the books
printed at that period, a German, Wimpheling,
writes with pardonable pride in 1507:
“We Germans practically control the whole
intellectual market of civilized Europe;
<em>the books, however, which we bring to this
market are for the most part high-class
works, tending to the honor of God, the salvation
of souls, and the civilisation of the
people</em>.” How soon, alas, was this to
change! Even while these words were
written, the evil was already striking root,
and steps had been taken by the civil as
well as by the ecclesiastical power, to
<a name="png.p10" id="png.p10" href="#png.p10"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>prevent the printing and spreading of noxious
books.</p>

<p>But it was not until the beginning of the
so-called Reformation that the boundless
increase of heretical and other pernicious
literature called for radical and extensive
measures. They began in 1520 with the
solemn condemnation of Luther’s doctrine
and the prohibition of his writings. About
that time the first indexes or catalogues of
forbidden books appeared. They were not
issued by the popes, but emanated mostly
from bishops, provincial councils, or universities.
The civil power was expected to
enforce them. In some cases the princes
themselves or the magistrates of cities and
republics issued their own indexes, in full
harmony and after consultation with the
clergy.</p>

<p>As the object of these measures was to
safeguard the faithful against imminent
danger, we can easily understand that catalogues
of forbidden books were most numerous
in those countries that were most
exposed to heresy, namely, Germany, Belgium,
France, and Northern Italy.</p>

<p><a name="png.p11" id="png.p11" href="#png.p11"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>It is remarkable that Henry VIII of
England, who afterwards fell away from
the Church, was among the first to legislate
against heretical books, his index of
forbidden books appearing as early as 1526.
After his apostasy he continued with increased
severity the policy of prohibiting
books which he deemed objectionable.</p>


<h3 id="i_4">4. The Roman Index.</h3>

<p>More than thirty years after the first
index of Henry VIII had appeared, the
first Roman Index of Forbidden Books was
compiled and issued by order of Paul IV.
It remained in force only a few years, till
1564, when the so-called Tridentine Index
was published under Pius IV. It was
called “Tridentine,” because it had been
drawn up by a commission appointed for
this purpose by the Council of Trent. It
was milder than the Index of Paul IV, and
contained divers “Index rules,” the forerunners
of the general decrees embodied in
the Constitution “Officiorum ac munerum.”</p>

<p>The Tridentine Index remained <em>the</em> Roman
Index for more than three hundred
<a name="png.p12" id="png.p12" href="#png.p12"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>years. Its “rules” were occasionally modified,
new regulations were added or old
ones abrogated, other books were inserted
in the catalogue; but the essential features
remained the same.</p>

<p>In 1897, Leo XIII took the matter up
again. The index of forbidden books was
thoroughly revised. About a thousand
were dropped. The “rules,” too, were
overhauled, “to make them milder, without
altering their nature, so that it cannot be
difficult or irksome for any person of good
will to obey them.”</p>

<p>This, then, represents the whole book
legislation of the Church. There are no
other documents, except the decrees by
which, as occasion demanded, individual
books were forbidden. The encyclical of
Pius X on Modernism merely enjoins on
the bishops special vigilance in regard to
publications infected with modernistic
views.</p>

<p>This universal legislation, however, does
not preclude the local prohibition of books
by bishops or other ecclesiastical authorities.
Thus Spain had, until 1820, its own
<a name="png.p13" id="png.p13" href="#png.p13"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Index, controlled by the Spanish Inquisition.</p>


<h3 id="i_5">5. Books Forbidden by General or Particular
Decrees.</h3>

<p>As we have already mentioned, the Constitution
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Officiorum ac munerum</span>” establishes
the general laws by which books are
forbidden. As will be seen in our Summary,
these laws deal with classes of books.
The only one named expressly is the Bible.
But all the books clearly contained in these
classes are as strictly, and sometimes even
more strictly, condemned than those listed
singly in the second part of the Index.</p>

<p>Pope Leo changed the Tridentine rules
“without altering their nature.” It is, indeed,
difficult to see how the nature of these
regulations could have been changed. They
simply express the point of view from
which the Church must look upon objectionable
publications. While opposing and
condemning spoken error, the Church
surely cannot allow full sway to the printed.
In regard to the second part, or Index
proper, many wrong notions are current.
<a name="png.p14" id="png.p14" href="#png.p14"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>14<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>One of these is, that this Index contains
<em>all</em> the books forbidden by the Church, and
that there are no others which we are
obliged to avoid. From the foregoing remarks,
it must, on the contrary, be concluded
that there are many other books forbidden
by the laws of the Church. The
worst of them are not in this special Index
at all, because they fall under the general
decrees.</p>

<p>It is by no means the intention of the
Roman authorities to catalogue all the literary
virus that has been vomited forth by
printing presses all over the world in the
course of four and a half centuries. By
means of the general laws laid down in the
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Officiorum ac munerum</span>” we are in all
cases able to see our duty.</p>

<p>There are especially two purposes for
which books are prohibited separately and
by name.</p>

<p>Whenever there is a doubt about the nature
of a book, recourse may be had to
Rome; sometimes the Roman authorities
appointed for this purpose, will take up the
<a name="png.p15" id="png.p15" href="#png.p15"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>matter without being appealed to. They
will investigate and decide by putting the
book on the Index, or, by dismissing it.
This is the case with most books publicly
censured. It was the case with the books of
Schell and Loisy, which, it was strongly
urged by learned men, propagated ideas
contrary, or at least dangerous, to the faith,
though a host of followers admired them
as orthodox masterpieces. Rome had to
speak, and settled the controversy by condemning
the books in question.</p>

<p>Dismissal does not always mean that a
book is unobjectionable. The authorities
may refrain from pronouncing deserved
condemnation for reasons of prudence and
expediency.</p>

<p>Sometimes the preservation of discipline
or religious unity necessitates this step.
Thus about two hundred years ago the Pope
had imposed silence on two factions that
were carrying on a theological feud. This
silence was violated on both sides, a book
appearing for the defence of either position.
What was more natural than that both
<a name="png.p16" id="png.p16" href="#png.p16"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>books should be put on the Index? These
and similar cases could not be covered so
clearly by the general decrees.</p>

<p>What has thus far been said, offers a
partial solution of another current error.
The Index is not a studiously selected, not
even a systematically arranged catalogue of
objectionable books. It was the need of
the moment, doctrinal blunders, cavillations
and heresies, grievous trespasses against
discipline and charity, proceeding from animosity
or want of tact, that caused the insertion
of most of the books. In nearly all
cases the Roman authorities confine themselves
to books concerning which they are
appealed to; and as there is no system in
the making of these appeals, there can be
no system in the condemnations. In the
new Leonine edition of the Index the
books are enumerated alphabetically by authors
or pseudonyms; anonymous books
are listed according to titles.</p>

<p>It must now be obvious to the attentive
reader why most of the books put on the
Index are works on theology, or on the history
and government of the Church, and
<a name="png.p17" id="png.p17" href="#png.p17"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>why (as may be expected in the case of such
publications), a considerable percentage
are written in Latin. However, a goodly
number of books are on the Index because
they are detrimental to good morals. There
are very few there which treat of the natural
sciences. The Index will not busy itself
with publications on electricity or
X-rays, unless an author on a subject of
this sort devote a considerable part of his
work to attacks upon religion.</p>

<p>There are some well-meaning people
who, while agreeing that the productions
of Zola, Dumas and other writers of the
same sort, fully deserve condemnation, cannot
understand why works like Ranke’s
<cite>History of the Popes</cite>, which is an acknowledged
authority in its line, should be proscribed.
Such works are not on the Index
for the good things they contain, but for
the poison they mix with the wholesome
food so cleverly that it takes more than
ordinary scholarship and discretion to separate
the one from the other.</p>

<p>The Roman Committee of Cardinals,
which has charge of this part of ecclesiastical
<a name="png.p18" id="png.p18" href="#png.p18"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>discipline, is not at all bent on proscribing
books. Works like the one mentioned
are never put on the Index unless it
is quite clear that the mischief to be feared
from them will far outweigh the good they
may do. Scholars and students well
grounded in their faith, who have a real
and legitimate cause for reading a forbidden
book can easily obtain a dispensation.</p>

<p>It is clear from the preceding explanations
that a book may sometimes be
dropped from the Index. This is done
when a book has long ceased to be dangerous,
or a cause of dissension, or if it has
fallen into oblivion. Thus Pope Leo XIII
caused to be expunged about a thousand
titles. This does not imply a reproach for
the authorities of former centuries, much
less the giving up of an iota of the old principles.</p>


<h3 id="i_6">6. Duties Imposed by Law and by
Nature.</h3>

<p>Suppose a person were so well grounded
in faith and virtue, so thoroughly versed
in theology, philosophy, and the natural
sciences, that the reading of books e. g.
<a name="png.p19" id="png.p19" href="#png.p19"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>on Christian Science, or the works of Voltaire,
would not harm him. The Index prohibits
these books; would he whom they
could not harm be allowed to read them?
As we put the case, he would, by reading
them, not commit the sin of seriously endangering
his soul. Yet he would sin by
disregarding a positive law of the Church.
These laws are like the precautionary
measures taken by the civil authorities in
times of epidemic; if they are to have the
desired effect, they must be observed by all.
When the community is under quarantine,
those who declare themselves free from
the disease must observe the regulations as
well as the rest.</p>

<p>Let those who think they have <em>a good
reason</em> for reading a forbidden book, and
who are not mistaken in supposing that
there is no danger for them, humbly ask
for permission, as did the Saints. By doing
so they declare that the standpoint of
the Church is theirs, and that they willingly
submit to a power which was entrusted
with the care of “teaching to observe whatsoever
I have commanded you.” “We
<a name="png.p20" id="png.p20" href="#png.p20"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>have to develop a loving habit of loyalty
and obedience to the Church as to Christ,
our Savior.”</p>

<p>Suppose, on the other hand, there were
no Church laws prohibiting pernicious
reading. In that case should we be allowed
to read any book we pleased? By
no means. We should then, it is true, by
reading, e. g., Zola’s novels, not commit an
act of disobedience to the Church. But,
as already hinted, there is another duty imposed
on us by God Himself—the grave
duty to guard our soul from serious danger.
This duty does not depend on any positive
law or decree of authority, and it equally
binds the Christian and the non-Christian.
It is expressed in the fifth commandment:
“Thou shalt not kill.” This duty corresponds
on our part to what we ask of God
in the sixth petition of the Our Father:
“Lead us not into temptation.” We
should undoubtedly violate it by reading
Zola’s filthy works. The prohibition of
these works by the Church merely adds
another obligation to that imposed by the
natural law, thereby considerably strengthening
<a name="png.p21" id="png.p21" href="#png.p21"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>21<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>our will and enabling us to resist
every enticement to read what can be read
only at a serious risk to our soul.</p>

<p>This grave duty, therefore, is not imposed
by the Church and cannot be taken
away by the Church. It is a natural duty
and as such remains in force even after
we are granted a formal permission, which
is neither intended nor able to suppress
temptations that may arise from the perusal
of bad books. If we have a good reason
to apply for permission—curiosity is
not a good reason—then and then only can
we expect a special protection from Divine
Providence. Of course, this protection
does not dispense us from the necessity of
using all the means of self-protection, both
natural and supernatural.</p>

<p>I know of a priest who was in every
way a model man. He fell suddenly away
from the Church, married, and is now a
foremost champion in the ranks of the
enemy. His apostasy is, not without reason,
attributed to the reading of infidel
books, though no doubt he had the necessary
dispensation.</p>

<p><a name="png.p22" id="png.p22" href="#png.p22"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>There was another priest, who has meanwhile
died the death of the just, a celebrated
author and art critic. In writing a
work on Voltaire he had to study the books
of that arch-agnostic. He obtained the requisite
permission, but, while perusing Voltaire’s
writings, he was on his knees, to
implore, as it were, by this humble posture
the protection of God against the wicked
influence to which he was exposed.</p>

<p>St. Francis of Sales, the great and
learned Bishop of Geneva, had obtained
permission to read the books of heretics in
order to refute them, and he is careful to
let his readers know the fact, at the same
time thanking God in pathetic words that
his soul had suffered no harm in so great
a danger.</p>

<p>This grave natural duty in the choice of
our reading matter extends much farther
than the legislation of the Church. Parents
and priests do not comply with their
obligation of controlling the reading of
their charges if they merely look up the Index
to see whether a certain book is mentioned
there. If an otherwise unobjectionable
<a name="png.p23" id="png.p23" href="#png.p23"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>book contains an obscene passage of a
page or so, no one will claim that it falls
under the general law prohibiting obscene
books. Nor is it likely to be put on the Index.
Yet such a book is apt to work havoc
in the innocent soul of your daughter or
son, perhaps in your own. As long as that
passage is in it, the book—even though it
is not on the Index—cannot and must not,
under pain of sin, be allowed in the hands
of children.</p>

<p>Would that this twofold duty were always
faithfully complied with, especially in
our large cities, where books of every sort
are within easy reach. Do not many, perhaps
all, public libraries offer among other
books such as are “derogatory to the
Church, the hierarchy, the religious state,”
and especially novels which “defend as
lawful or tolerable, freemasonry, suicide,
divorce”? How can we expect our young
people to have Catholic views on courtship
and marriage, on the priesthood, on the
veneration of the saints, if we allow them
to imbibe the ideas of such writers as Balzac
or Dumas? It is deplorable enough
<a name="png.p24" id="png.p24" href="#png.p24"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that the modern novel is the catechism of
millions outside of the Church. We must
not allow it to displace the Catholic catechism
or to unteach, totally or in part, the
truths taught by it.</p>


<h3 id="i_7">7. Who Puts Books On The Index?</h3>

<p>The popes have at all times exercised the
prerogative of their supreme office as
guardians of the faith by condemning books
opposed to the faith. The latest of such
condemnations is that, in 1862, of the works
of the Munich professor, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Frohschammer</span>,
who answered this condemnation by falling
away from the Church. There are in all
144 books that were individually proscribed
by a papal document. In Pope Leo’s edition
they are marked with a dagger. Yet
only in cases of the utmost importance did
the popes act themselves. To facilitate the
government of the world-wide Church, in
the course of centuries special committees
of cardinals were appointed, to whom
part of the pontiff’s various duties were
entrusted. These committees are styled
Congregations. A larger or smaller
<a name="png.p25" id="png.p25" href="#png.p25"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>25<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>number of learned priests and bishops, generally
called Consultors, assist the cardinals
and practically do the greater part of the
work, though the final decision in all cases
is reserved to the cardinals.</p>

<p>The highest of these Roman Congregations<!-- TN: original lacks "s" -->
is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sacrum Officium</i> or “General
Inquisition,” called also the “Congregation
of the Holy Office,” of which the
Pope himself is Prefect. Its purpose is
especially to watch over the purity of faith.
It is this august body that, after the Pope
himself, is in the first place called to judge
the doctrines propounded in any book. It
was this Congregation that performed the
preparatory work for the first Index of
Paul IV, and, although another congregation
for the examining of books was soon
after established, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sacrum Officium</i> continued
to exercise the same power. As
may be expected, especially such works as
seemed to affect the integrity of the faith,
were submitted to this supreme court. In
our days the works of the French priest
Loisy were proscribed by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sacrum
Officium</i>.</p>

<p><a name="png.p26" id="png.p26" href="#png.p26"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>But the bulk of this work is at present
performed by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Congregatio Indicis librorum
prohibitorum</i>, or “Congregation of
the Index of Forbidden Books.” It was
founded by Saint Pius V in 1571, seven
years after the publication of the Tridentine
Index. Since then about eighty per
cent. of all individual prohibitions of books
have emanated from it. Its Prefect is a
cardinal. The present one is Cardinal Segna.
The perpetual assistant and secretary
are always members of the Dominican order.
Besides the seven or ten cardinals
there are about thirty consultors, many of
whom are bishops.</p>

<p>Though three or four prohibitions of
books have emanated from other Roman
authorities, the practice has been to let
either the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sacrum Officium</i> or the Congregation
of the Index decide in all cases.
The latter Congregation, moreover, had to
register all condemnations pronounced by
any of the legitimate authorities and to see
that they were entered in the new editions
of the Index.</p>

<p>Our present Holy Father, Pius X, has
<a name="png.p27" id="png.p27" href="#png.p27"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>lately brought about a long desired reform
in the central government of the Church.
The competency of many of the Roman
Congregations has been more clearly defined,
and several of those originally instituted
have been either suppressed or
united with others. The Congregation of
the Index has received a wider sphere and
greater power. While formerly it passed
only on books in regard to which it was
expressly appealed to, it has now become
a regular vigilance committee for the whole
Church. The Holy Father says: “For
the future it shall be the province of this
Sacred Congregation not only to examine
diligently the books reported to it, to prohibit
them, if this should seem well, and
to concede dispensations; but also to officially
investigate in the best available way
whether writings of any kind that should
be condemned are being circulated; and to
remind the ordinaries how strictly they are
bound to condemn pernicious writings and
to denounce them to the Holy See.”</p>

<p>On the relation of the Congregation of
the Index to that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sacrum Officium</i>
<a name="png.p28" id="png.p28" href="#png.p28"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>28<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>(Holy Office) the Pope says: “As the
prohibition of books has very frequently
the scope of defense of the Faith, which
is also the object of the Congregation of
the Holy Office, we decree that in future
in all things relating to the prohibition of
books, and in those alone, the Cardinals,
Consultors and officers of both congregations,
may communicate with one another,
and that all of them shall be bound by the
same secret.”</p>

<p>The Roman Congregations are not infallible.
But they represent the Pope in
his highest capacity as shepherd of the entire
flock of Christ. Therefore we owe
them obedience. Their regulations and orders
must find us even more willing to
obey than those of our bishops and pastors,
to whom only a small portion of Christ’s
kingdom is entrusted.</p>


<h3 id="i_8">8. The Method of Examination.</h3>

<p>Our confidence in the fairness of the verdicts
of the S. Congregation of the Index
will be much increased, if we acquaint ourselves
with the method it follows in carrying
<a name="png.p29" id="png.p29" href="#png.p29"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>29<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>out its arduous, odious and yet very
important task. This method is practically
the same for both the Holy Office and the
Index. The usual procedure is based
mainly on the regulations laid down in the
Bull of Pope Benedict XIV, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sollicita ac
provida</span>.”</p>

<p>When a book is reported to the Index
Congregation, the secretary first tries to
ascertain whether it is worth examining.
He also inquires by letter from bishops and
other reliable persons about the advisability
of a condemnation. Several consultors
assist him in this preliminary investigation;
but the Cardinal Prefect has to ratify
their decision.</p>

<p>If they think the book should be examined,
it is handed to a consultor, who has
to study it carefully and to draw up a detailed
report, noting exactly the passages
which he finds objectionable, and conscientiously
pointing out all redeeming features.
His report together with the book is
passed on to other consultors, each of
whom can thus satisfy himself whether the
first “examiner’s” verdict is fair, and has
<a name="png.p30" id="png.p30" href="#png.p30"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>30<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>also an opportunity to formulate his own
view. One question they have to answer is,
whether the condemnation is likely to have
a good effect.</p>

<p>After comparing the opinions of the consultors,
the secretary of the Congregation
draws up an official statement of the reasons
for and against a prohibition, which
statement together with the book is submitted
to the Cardinal Prefect, by whose
orders it is printed and a copy sent to each
cardinal and consultor of the Congregation.</p>

<p>Next a preparatory meeting of the consultors
is called for a previous discussion.
The consultor who examined the book
speaks first, then all the others, beginning
with the youngest. The secretary carefully
records the views of each consultor,
together with his reasons.</p>

<p>At least ten days must elapse between
this meeting and the solemn session of the
whole Congregation, in which the question
is finally decided by a vote of the cardinals.</p>

<p>The decision arrived at is commonly
given in one of these four technical phrases:
<a name="png.p31" id="png.p31" href="#png.p31"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Damnetur</i>, “condemned”; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dimittatur</i>, “dismissed”;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donec corrigatur</i>, “forbidden until
amended”; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res dilata</i>, “the case is postponed.”
The verdict <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donec corrigatur</i> of
course, can only be given when a book admits
of correction; when it is thoroughly
bad (e. g. written for the sole purpose of
eulogizing Freemasonry or maligning Catholic
bishops), a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">donec corrigatur</i> would
have no meaning.</p>

<p>Finally, the secretary of the Congregation
lays the whole matter before the Pope,
who, if he sees fit, authorizes the publication
of the decree.</p>

<p>Nobody will deny that this is a very excellent
method of procedure. Under it a
book is examined at least three times, and
twenty-five or thirty picked scholars participate
in the proceedings, each of whom
has taken a solemn oath never to allow
himself to be influenced by sympathy or
antipathy and to have nothing in view
but the eternal welfare of souls.</p>

<p>If the author is a Catholic, he must be
informed before the decree is published.
If but a few copies of the book have been
<a name="png.p32" id="png.p32" href="#png.p32"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>sold, and the author promises either to suppress
it, or to issue an amended edition,
if possible, the decree is not published. But
even when this cannot be prevented, e. g.
when a whole edition is already in circulation,
credit is given to the author in the
decree itself for declaring his submission,
by adding the words: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">auctor laudabiliter
se subjecit</i>, “the author has praiseworthily
submitted.”</p>

<p>Great care is taken to have all books examined
by men who are not only well
versed in the subject matter, but who also
understand thoroughly the language in
which they happen to be written. Nor
does the Congregation in important cases
confine itself to its regular consultors;
whenever it seems advisable, the services
of other competent critics are enlisted.</p>

<p>All the members of the Congregation are
bound by oath to keep absolute secrecy
with regard to every detail of the official
transactions, no matter whether a book under
discussion is finally condemned or not.
By this means each feels more free in
<a name="png.p33" id="png.p33" href="#png.p33"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>giving his opinion, and the reputation of the
author is spared as long and as much as
possible.</p>


<h3 id="i_9">9. The Spirit of the Congregation of the
Index.</h3>

<p>As to the spirit that should actuate the
members of the Congregation of the Index,
the rules laid down for its consultors by
Benedict XIV in the Bull “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sollicita ac
provida</span>” are instructive.</p>

<p>“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ipsos ... monemus ac vehementer
hortamur ut in examine iudicioque librorum
sequentes regulas diligenter inspiciant
accurateque custodiant.</i>” “We wish
to admonish and exhort them most urgently
to study carefully and observe accurately
the following rules for examining and judging
books:</p>

<p>1. Let them not imagine that it is their
duty to use every means to bring about
the condemnation of the books submitted
to them. They ought rather to study such
books conscientiously, without passion or
anxiety (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sedato animo</span>), in order to
<a name="png.p34" id="png.p34" href="#png.p34"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>furnish such well-found observations, such
objective reasons, as will enable the Congregation
to pass a just verdict.</p>

<p>2. Should a consultor find that he is not
competent to judge a book which he is
asked to examine, let him know that he will
not be free from guilt, either before God
or man, unless he at once confesses his
incompetence. Far from damaging his reputation
with the pope or the cardinals, such
an avowal will rather gain their esteem and
praise for his straightforwardness and honesty.</p>

<p>3. Let them set aside absolutely all prejudice
in favor of nation, family, school or
order; let them relinquish all party spirit,
and keep before their minds the undoubted
doctrine of the Church, as laid down in the
decrees of the councils, in papal documents,
etc., knowing that there are opinions that,
while they seem certain to one nation,
school, or order, are, with the knowledge
of the Holy See, opposed by others; the
Holy See leaving all these opinions in their
degree of probability.</p>

<p>4. It must also be borne in mind that
<a name="png.p35" id="png.p35" href="#png.p35"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>it is impossible to judge fairly the meaning
of a passage, unless the entire book is studied,
and unless the various statements
found in different sections are compared
with one another, and the whole purpose of
the book is steadily kept in view.</p>

<p>5. If an author who enjoys the reputation
of sound theological learning, has
used expressions which might be understood
in a wrong as well as in a right meaning,
fairness demands that they be, as far
as possible, interpreted in his favor.</p>

<p>These and similar rules ... must
be kept before the minds of the consultors,
in order that they may have due regard for
their own conscience, the good name of authors,
the interests of the Church, and the
welfare of souls.”</p>


<h3 id="i_10">10. Further Explanations.</h3>


<h4 id="i_10_a">A. Why an Author is Not Permitted to Defend
His Book.</h4>

<p>If an author could accompany every copy
of his work that leaves the bookstore or
library, he would be able to explain
<a name="png.p36" id="png.p36" href="#png.p36"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>obscure passages and to show what meaning
he wished doubtful phrases to convey to
the reader. It is precisely because he cannot
multiply himself that he employs printer’s
ink to convey his ideas to others. It
must, therefore, be supposed that his words
mean what he intends to say. The reader,
at any rate, has no corrective. He has
only the book, not the author to fall back
upon. It is impossible to recur to the author
when there is question of the correctness
or incorrectness of a book. If the author
has to be called upon to explain the
meaning of his book, he should have left it
unprinted.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is hardly credible, as Pope
Benedict XIV points out, that anything an
author might advance in his favor, should
escape so many examiners without receiving
due attention and emphasis.</p>

<p>The whole procedure is primarily not intended
as a measure against the author,
although pecuniary loss <em>may</em> ensue, but to
protect the faithful. A condemnation is
rather a warning to the would-be reader,
than a punishment inflicted upon the
<a name="png.p37" id="png.p37" href="#png.p37"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>37<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>author. It is not an act of jurisdiction.
Were the author’s personal views under
investigation, he would be summoned personally
before another tribunal and tried
according to a method that would give him
the amplest opportunity to defend himself.</p>

<p>These considerations also show that the
condemnation of a book after its author’s
death is not unreasonable. A book remains
what it is independently of its author. Nor
would it change the nature of a book were
the author afterwards to prove his orthodoxy
to the satisfaction of the authorities,
or to do penance in sackcloth and ashes,
or for the rest of his mortal life consort
with the Trappists. Were it morally certain,
however, that almost all the copies of
a book were destroyed, a prohibitory decree
would fail of its purpose.</p>


<h4 id="i_10_b">B. The Index Does Not Advertise Bad Books.</h4>

<p>Now and then there is expressed an apprehension
lest the Index, far from suppressing,
rather advertises bad books and
arouses a desire to read them. It is even
<a name="png.p38" id="png.p38" href="#png.p38"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>maintained that in some cases evil-minded
authors have intentionally written so as to
get their books put on the Index.</p>

<p>Now, every prohibitory law may have
the effect of increasing the inclination of
men towards the prohibited thing or act.
Thus a person may possibly feel a stronger
appetite for meat on Friday than on any
other day of the week. We have inherited
this tendency from Eve, who, when
tempted, saw that the forbidden fruit “<em>was
good to eat and fair to the eye and delightful
to behold</em>,” and then proceeded to violate
the first prohibitory law ever given.
But is that a reason to do away with every
prohibitory law?</p>

<p>Who does not see at once that the Index
must prove a very poor advertising medium?
Those who have it are certainly not
the prospective buyers of immoral novels
or of works which propagate heretical
views in theology; while those who hanker
after sensationalism or doubtful theology
will not invest $2.25 for a book list which
contains, e. g. for the year 1898, fully eight
<a name="png.p39" id="png.p39" href="#png.p39"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>titles, four of which are German, and for
1903 fifteen, all French.</p>

<p>This side of the question, as we have remarked
elsewhere, is also in each case carefully
weighed by the Sacred Congregation,
before it resolves upon a prohibition.</p>

<p>Even if the sale of a book should be increased
by the fact of its condemnation, the
Index would nevertheless achieve its main
purpose, namely, to warn the faithful that
the ideas advocated in the proscribed book
are contrary to faith and morals. This is
enough for all men of good will to enable
them to shun the poison. Those who refuse
to heed the warning will have to blame
their own ignorance or malice if the reading
of a condemned book results in spiritual
hurt.</p>


<h4 id="i_10_c">C. Index Decisions Not Omitted for Fear of
Apostasies.</h4>

<p>A book, we are reminded, often represents
the opinions not only of its author,
but of many of his disciples and admirers.
By forbidding it and thus branding such
<a name="png.p40" id="png.p40" href="#png.p40"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>opinions as erroneous, it is said, many influential
men may become embittered and
may even be driven into an attitude of open
hostility.</p>

<p>However, the Church is in duty bound
to exercise her guardianship; which she
cannot do if every one is to have his own
way. Nor can the Church neglect the mass
of her children in order to accommodate
this or that coterie or school, whose opinions
are manifestly wrong.</p>

<p>Moreover, to be a trustworthy guide, the
Church must state the truth clearly and unmistakably.
The faithful are not guided
by ambiguous circumlocutions, by terms
that may be understood in two or perhaps
more ways. Neither may she keep exclusively
in the lofty heights of theory; but
she must instruct with regard to the facts
of everyday life. The dangers arising from
books are <em>concrete</em> not <em>abstract</em>, and they
must be met by concrete measures. This
can be done effectively only by an energetic
and unmistakable “thou shalt not,”
which makes men realize that they are
“under authority.”</p>

<p><a name="png.p41" id="png.p41" href="#png.p41"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a>No one has ever stated the truth more
clearly, more unmistakably than Christ our
Lord. Was it not precisely for this very
fact that “many of His disciples went back
and walked no more with Him”? (John 6, 67.)</p>


<h4 id="i_10_d">D. The “Good Catholic.”</h4>

<p>“I am a Catholic. I live up to my religion
and go regularly to the sacraments.
I have had a good Catholic education and
hear a sermon every Sunday. I do not
see why I should be afraid to read any
book, even if it belonged to those forbidden
by the Index.”</p>

<p>You may do so; but you may fare in
consequence as David fared—David who
was a saint and yet committed adultery
and murder. If you read a forbidden book
without permission, you are as good a Catholic
as one who eats meat on Friday. The
object of the law of abstinence is to make
sure that every Christian performs at least
a certain minimum of penance. Now there
are saintly persons who, in imitation of our
crucified Savior, do more penance on
<a name="png.p42" id="png.p42" href="#png.p42"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>42<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>ordinary days than the average Catholic does by
abstaining from meat on twenty or more
Fridays; and yet they are not exempted
from the law of abstinence and would be
the last to claim such an exemption.</p>

<p>Similarly the object of the Index is to
make sure that every Christian avoids at
least the worst books. By obeying its laws
we declare that our standpoint is that of
the Church of God. This result cannot be
obtained unless the prohibition is made universal,
exempting no one, no matter how
pious or learned he may be. Therefore,
<em>all</em> Christians, good and bad, priests, religious
and lay people, students and professors,
unless they have a dispensation, are
bound by the ecclesiastical laws regarding
books. By asking for a dispensation we implicitly
acknowledge and approve of the
official position of the Church on the subject
of wicked books, and, so far as in us
lies, ratify and sanction the reasons which
lead to their condemnation.</p>

<p>You say you are a good Catholic, and
therefore this law does not bind you. Are
<a name="png.p43" id="png.p43" href="#png.p43"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>43<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>there any commandments of the Church
that bind only bad Catholics?</p>


<h4 id="i_10_e">E. A Mortal Sin.</h4>

<p>“I am told that a transgression of the
Index law is a mortal sin. Can it be true
that the Church, the kindest of mothers,
should load us down with such a severe obligation?”</p>

<p>According to the theologians, the reading
of a forbidden book, or of a considerable
part of it, <em>is</em> a mortal sin. The selection
of the books on which our souls feed is a
matter of no small importance. True, the
Church is the kindest of mothers; but she is
also the wisest. To direct the consciences
of her children and “<em>to restrain them from
the reading of bad books as from a deadly
poison</em>,” is the great object of her legislation.
Under the leadership of a mastermind
like that of Leo XIII, the Roman
authorities have labored for years in formulating
the present ecclesiastical laws about
books. These laws are the voice of the supreme
pastor, the successor of St. Peter.
<a name="png.p44" id="png.p44" href="#png.p44"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>44<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Let us not spurn it like the heathen and
the publican.</p>


<h4 id="i_10_f">F. The Galileo Case.</h4>

<p>The Roman Congregations are no more
infallible than our bishops and pastors.
And yet there is practically but one case,
during more than three centuries, in which
they are accused of having made a mistake.
It is the condemnation, by both the
Holy Office and the Index, of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Galileo Galilei
Linceo</i> (died 1639) for defending the
theory that the earth moves around its
own axis and around the sun.</p>

<p>This teaching was according to the common
belief of Catholics and Protestants,
at that time, clearly opposed to Holy
Scripture, which the Church was bound to
vindicate. If Galileo’s theory was true,
the traditional interpretation of sundry
Bible texts would have had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The Church had weighty reasons for not
allowing this. The new theory was not
at all certain. Galileo himself admitted he
could not establish more than a probability.
<a name="png.p45" id="png.p45" href="#png.p45"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Several very obvious objections he was
unable to explain satisfactorily. None of
the real proofs used in our days were
known to him. He was told by the Jesuit
Cardinal Bellarmin, if he could advance any
convincing proof for his theory, the traditional
interpretation of those passages
would be given up. But all Galileo had
to offer was an ingenious hypothesis. Had
he advocated it as such with due respect
for the time-honored interpretation of the
Book of Books, had he not used bold, sometimes
bitter and defying language, no steps
would have been taken against him, who
had until then been a favorite of the pope
and of many dignitaries. As matters stood,
“the Church could wait for the education
of a physical system, but she could not
allow a change in the universally accepted
interpretation of Scripture, before the necessity
of such a change was proved.”
(Guggenberger, <cite>History of the Christian
Era</cite>. Vol. II, pp. 456, etc.)</p>

<p>“The marvelous unanimity of the enemies
of the Church in concentrating all
their attacks against the Roman Congregation
<a name="png.p46" id="png.p46" href="#png.p46"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>46<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>on the case of Galileo, is a striking negative
testimony to the value of the decisions
of courts which have been at work for
centuries.” (<i>Rome.</i>)</p>


<h4 id="i_10_g">G. State and Protestant Book Laws.</h4>

<p>As we have already remarked, Henry VIII continued his policy of proscribing
books opposed to his views long after he
had constituted himself the head of the
English Church. Between 1526 and 1546
there were issued by the King’s authority
nine catalogues of books which Englishmen
were forbidden to read. Among these
books were the works of the continental
“reformers”; for some years the English
Bible; also writings against the King’s
matrimonial projects.</p>

<p>The Protestants on the continent followed
the same system. Calvin condemned
a Spanish physician, who happened to come
to Geneva, to be burned at the stake, because
he had written a heretical book. The
Protestant princes and republics had each
its special book-legislation, which was made
<a name="png.p47" id="png.p47" href="#png.p47"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>to serve not only religious but also political
purposes.</p>

<p>After the middle of the eighteenth century,
in almost all Catholic countries, the
civil power usurped the monopoly of proscribing
books, and practiced it in a truly
despotic way. Thus in Austria 639 books
were forbidden within five years. No book
was allowed to be printed without <em>previous</em>
permission, not even on forestry or cattle-raising.
Bishops were severely reproved
for enforcing the prohibitions of the Roman
Index in their seminaries.</p>

<p><i>Napoleon I</i> had a publisher shot, practically
without trial, for issuing a work
contrary to his political plans. One book
was publicly burned because it contained
the picture of Pius VII. To enable the
authorities to control the book trade more
effectively, no printing establishment was
allowed to have, in Paris more than four,
and in the provinces more than two, presses.</p>

<p>Needless to remark, the civil authorities
<em>have</em> the right to prohibit books that seriously
endanger the common welfare. If
<a name="png.p48" id="png.p48" href="#png.p48"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>they use this right in a reasonable way,
their measures are likely to bring about
good and prevent evil. We all have occasional
opportunities to observe this in the
measures taken against immoral literature
by the police or the post-office department.</p>


<h4 id="i_10_h">H. Some Examples of Submission to the Index.</h4>

<p>The first Roman Index, that of 1559, was
considered rather severe. One of the influential
men who tried hard to have its provisions
softened, was <i>Blessed Peter Canisius</i>,
the “Second Apostle of Germany.”
Yet the very letters he wrote to Rome for
this purpose show that he scrupulously observed
all the regulations, though he himself,
called the “Hammer of Heretics,”
surely incurred little personal risk by reading
forbidden books.</p>

<p>About 1698, a book by <i>Archbishop Fénelon</i>
was under investigation at Rome. Fénelon
was a great scholar and one of the
greatest preachers of all centuries, but he
was also a loyal son of the Church. He
knew a condemnation of his book would
<a name="png.p49" id="png.p49" href="#png.p49"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>mean his own condemnation in the eyes of
Catholic France. His friends as well as
his antagonists were eagerly awaiting
Rome’s decision on one of the great churchman’s
books. At last the verdict was pronounced
in the most solemn way by the
Pope himself, and it was a condemnation.
Fénelon was just ascending his pulpit,
March 25, 1699, when his brother broke
the news to him. The great Archbishop at
once proceeded to read to his own flock the
papal document and preached an eloquent
sermon on the obedience every Christian
owes to his superiors. We can imagine
what a profound impression his words must
have made. His was a truly heroic example
of self-abnegation.</p>

<p>In 1861 there died in Munich <i>Ernest von
Lasaulx</i>, a famous professor of the University.
In his writings he had now and then
been very bold, and it was rumored that the
Congregation of the Index thought of censuring
some of his books. Von Lasaulx
knew this. A few weeks before his death
he made an implicit retraction of the errors
he might have involuntarily committed,
<a name="png.p50" id="png.p50" href="#png.p50"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>which was forwarded to Rome by his
friends. Already some years before he had
declared that he had never intended to contravene
the doctrine of the Church, but
that he feared there were many errors in
his books. “If Rome would think it advisable
to put my books on the Index, I
should consider the verdict perfectly just,
<em>since I firmly believe that such measures
are truly in the interest of the Catholic
Church in our times</em>.” Four of his books
were really condemned after his death.</p>

<p>In July, 1906, an Italian novel, <cite lang="it" xml:lang="it">Il Santo</cite>,
(The Saint) by Fogazzaro, was put on the
Index. The author “submitted himself.”
An American edition of the book had meanwhile
appeared; “but the prohibition by
the Roman authorities was duly respected
by the publishers of the leading Catholic
papers of America, which declined to accept
advertisements of the book.” (Putnam.)</p>

 /></span></span></a>SECTION II<br
 /><b>A SUMMARY OF THE INDEX</b></h2>


<h3 id="ii_1">1. Our Duties in Relation to Forbidden
Books.</h3>

<p><span class="smc">Rule 1.</span> We are not allowed to read
forbidden books, nor any considerable portion
of them, even if those portions be in
themselves harmless. If, however, a book
is forbidden merely on account of the one
or other objectionable passage it contains,
the objection ceases as soon as these passages
are expunged or rendered illegible.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Rule 2.</span> No one, whether he be the
owner or not, is allowed to keep a forbidden
book. He must either destroy it, or
give or sell it to some one who has permission,
or he must obtain permission for himself.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Rule 3.</span> It is not lawful for a Catholic
<a name="png.p52" id="png.p52" href="#png.p52"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>52<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>publisher or printer to issue, or print, or
reprint forbidden books. Nor may a bookseller
keep such books in stock, unless he
has obtained formal leave to do so.</p>

<p><i>Note 1.</i> Although all the members of
a Catholic family should endeavor to keep
forbidden books out of the home, the head
of the household is chiefly responsible before
God. It is to be remarked, however,
that Catholic librarians or servants do not
violate this law by keeping, handling, or
cataloguing forbidden books for their employers,
e. g. in the latter’s house, or in a
public library.</p>

<p><i>Note 2.</i> If a book or any particular issue
of a forbidden periodical calls for a
speedy public refutation, <em>and</em> if permission
to peruse it cannot be waited for, any educated
Catholic, who may be reasonably presumed
to be competent to refute it by sermon,
lecture or newspaper article, may read
such book or periodical without awaiting
special permission.</p>

<p><i>Note 3.</i> In all other cases, each and
every Catholic, be he priest or layman, professor
or student, must first obtain permission.
<a name="png.p53" id="png.p53" href="#png.p53"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Neither piety, nor learning, nor position
exempts one from this law. The
permission is granted by bishops and their
vicars general, who can also delegate this
power to others. When asking for this
permission the applicant should mention
the book which he thinks he has good reasons
to read.</p>

<p>The juridical question, whether the bishop’s
faculty is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ordinaria</i>, or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi-ordinaria</i>,
or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extra-ordinaria</i>, and how far it extends,
is not within the scope of this Summary.</p>

<p><i>Note 4.</i> All who are dispensed from
the Church law regarding forbidden books,
must apply every possible precaution, in
order that they may not suffer injury to
their faith or purity of heart. Such precautions
are: the hearing of sermons, the
reading of Catholic books, the frequenting
of Catholic society, regular prayers, and the
frequent and humble reception of the sacraments.</p>


<h3 id="ii_2">2. Forbidden Books.</h3>

<p><span class="smc">Rule 4. General Rule.</span>—Translations
of a forbidden book into any language, if
<a name="png.p54" id="png.p54" href="#png.p54"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>54<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>they faithfully reproduce the original, are
also forbidden.</p>


<h4 id="ii_2_a">A. The General Decrees Prohibit the Following
Publications.</h4>

<p><span class="smc">Rule 5</span>, a. Books defending heresies,
i. e. doctrines contrary to divine revelation.</p>

<p class="sub">b. Books derogatory to God, the
Blessed Virgin, the Saints.</p>

<p class="sub">c. Books vilifying the sacraments, the
clerical or religious state, the hierarchy, the
Church.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Rule 6.</span> Books professedly treating of,
narrating or teaching lewdness and obscenity.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Rule 7.</span> Books teaching or recommending
sorcery, Spiritism, Christian Science,
or other superstitions.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Rule 8.</span> Books defending as lawful or
harmless Freemasonry, divorce, Socialism,
suicide, duelling.</p>

<p><span class="smc">Rule 9.</span> <em>Those newspapers and periodicals</em>
which, not only now and then, but
regularly and of set purpose, attack religion
or morality, or propagate anti-Catholic
views.</p>

<p><a name="png.p55" id="png.p55" href="#png.p55"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>55<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><span class="smc">Rule 10.</span> Episcopal approbation, to be
printed in the beginning or at the end of
the book, is required for all editions of the
Bible or parts of the Bible in any language,
likewise for all prayer books, books of devotion
and of practical piety. Without
episcopal authorization such publications
are forbidden, though they may have been
issued by the most learned and pious men.</p>

<p><i>Note 1.</i> Leaflets which are so small
that they cannot be called books, or even
booklets or pamphlets, do not fall under
this law. But if they are not approved by
the bishop, the duty of making sure that
they contain nothing erroneous devolves
upon those who use them.</p>

<p><i>Summaries of indulgences</i>, however, no
matter how small, always need episcopal
approbation and may not be circulated
without it.</p>

<p><i>Note 2.</i> All editions of the Bible, edited
by non-Catholics, in ancient as well as
modern languages, are permitted to those,
and those only, who are engaged in
serious theological or biblical studies, provided,
however, that the <span class="allsc">PROLEGOMENA
<a name="png.p56" id="png.p56" href="#png.p56"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>56<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>AND ANNOTATIONS</span> do not of set purpose
impugn the Catholic faith. It is not
enough that the text itself is faithfully and
completely rendered.</p>

<p><i>Note 3.</i> An exception has also been
made in favor of those classics, ancient and
modern, which on account of their obscenity
fall under rule 6. In as far as they are
models of style they may be read by persons
engaged in teaching university or
higher college classes of literature, by those
who are preparing for such a position in
the near future, and by those who, on account
of their profession, e. g. as critics or
authors of literary works, cannot well do
without them. (See note 4 above.)</p>


<p class="tb">Whenever we know, or discover while
reading, that a book undoubtedly belongs
to any one of these classes, we may be sure
that it is a work which our Holy Mother
the Church does not wish to see in our
hands, and we must then act according to
the words of Christ: “He who heareth
you, heareth Me, and he who despiseth
you despiseth Me.” No need of first
<a name="png.p57" id="png.p57" href="#png.p57"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>57<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>looking up the catalogue of forbidden
books; whether the volume in question is
mentioned there or not, makes no difference.
Nor does it matter what the literary
character of the book is. An apparently
learned history of the seizure of Rome in
1870, written with the obvious intention of
maligning Pius IX, is forbidden just as
well as a novel written for the same purpose,
or the prayer book of some Protestant
sect.</p>


<h4 id="ii_2_b">B. Books Forbidden by Particular Decrees.</h4>

<p>The following list contains a number of
titles which every English-speaking Catholic
ought to know. All the books that
have been put on the Index during the last
few years have been mentioned, not so
much for completeness’ sake, as because
they contain the palmary error of our time,
namely: Modernism, and among its doctrines
especially the unchristian treatment
of the Bible. None of these books are
written in English. But some have been
and others may soon be translated. Their
